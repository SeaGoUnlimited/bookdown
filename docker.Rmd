# Accessing the Database with Docker {#docker}

Some info about Docker 

*Note: Ensure all required software is installed before starting Docker instructions (see 1.1: Required Software)*

## Instructions for Mac/Linux users 
The only text you need to copy and paste into the terminal is offset in a different font below.

**1. Open command terminal**
    - Shortcut: Command+space, type "terminal"

<br>
**2. Login to Docker account in the terminal**

$     `docker login --username=your_username`

![This example uses “seatizen” as an example username. The information behind the $ is information about your computer and will be different for every user. Hitting enter after this line will prompt you to enter your password (The terminal most likely won’t show any characters as you type, but it is recognizing keystrokes). Press enter again to complete login.](images/login.png)

<br>
**3. Pull docker image:**

$     `docker pull cinms/seatizen-science`

![This step takes a while (15-20 min); you can see each component downloading and being pulled from the server in the terminal window. When the process is complete, it should look like this and you can move to step 4.](images/pull.png)

<br>
**4. Run image:**

$     `docker run –it cinms/seatizen-science`

![This step also will take 10 or so minutes. You will see new Trip IDs appearing in the terminal window!

<br>
**5. View container IDs and copy the most recently created one:** 

$     `docker ps -a`

![](images/containers.png)


<br>
**6. Use “docker cp” to copy the database to a local folder:**

$     `docker cp containerID:/spotter.sqlite/file/path/here`  

![Example shown for a new folder called "Database" in Users/mollywilliams on my local drive.](images/cp.png)


Nice job! Jump to Chapter 3 to learn how to navigate the database using SQLite Studio.

## Instructions for Windows users

**1. [Download Docker Toolbox](https://download.docker.com/win/stable/DockerToolbox.exe )**
Click the DockerToolbox.exe file and follow the instructions in the “Welcome to Docker Toolbox Setup Wizard.” Once the download is complete, open Docker Quickstart Terminal.

**2. Login to Docker**
In the terminal, type "docker login". Once you hit enter, Docker Quickstart Terminal will prompt you to enter your username and password. You can either use the previously setup account (Username=cinms, Password=cinmswhales) or your own account. When you are successfully logged in, Docker Quickstart Terminal will say “Login Succeeded”.


<br>
**3. Pull docker image:**

$     `docker pull cinms/seatizen-science`

<br>
**4. Run image:**

$     `docker run –it cinms/seatizen-science`

<br>
**5. View container IDs and copy the most recently created one:** 

$     `docker ps -a`

<br>
**6. Use “docker cp” to copy the database to a local folder:**

$     `docker cp containerID:spotter.sqlite “c:\file\path”`  

<br>
**7. Mount Docker to a local database using the Docker Quickstart Terminal:**

$    `docker run –it –v c:/Local/Path/For/DatabaseFolder/spotter.sqlite cinms/seatizen-science`

*For example: docker run –it -v c:/Users/ckorm/spotter.sqlite cinms/seatizen-science*

## Instructions for Kitematic 
(for Windows users, as an alternative to Docker Toolbox)

1. Setup Docker on your computer by installing docker toolbox: https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/ 

2. Open Docker Quickstart Terminal 

3. Search for “seatizen-science”:
	-Click “create”

3. Run the “seatizen-science”:
	-If it isn’t running already, click “Run”

4. Click DOCKER CLI or Use Docker Quickstart Terminal: 
	-Should open command prompt/terminal 

5. See all container ID’s:

	$docker ps -a

6. Copy the container ID that was just created and use: “docker cp” to copy the database to a local folder:
 
 
Mac or Linux:
docker cp  container ID:/spotter.sqlite  /Users/folder /spotter.sqlite
Windows:
docker cp containerID:spotter.sqlite “c:\Document\spotter.sqlite”
Finally, to update your newly acquired database in the future, mount the seatizen_science_app to the local database. 

-	Type “docker run” space “-v” then the path to your local spotter.sqlite database, then type “:/spotter.sqlite” followed by a space, and type “seangoral/seatizen_science_app” and press ENTER.

EX:

docker run -v /Local/Path/For/DatabaseFolder/spotter.sqlite:/spotter.sqlite seangoral/seatizen_science_app
